# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
___

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
**Requirement Analysis** is important in the Software development lifecycle to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. 
____

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
* Clarity and Understanding: It helps stakeholders understand what they expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
* Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
* Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
* Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
* Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️
* Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
* Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
* Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
* Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
* Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️
* Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
* Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
* Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation 📚
* Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
* User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
* Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊
* Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
* Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
* Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation ✅
* Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
* Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.
