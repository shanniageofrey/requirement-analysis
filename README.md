# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
___

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
**Requirement Analysis** is important in the Software development lifecycle to ensure that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform. 
____

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
* Clarity and Understanding: It helps stakeholders understand what they expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
* Scope Definition: Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
* Basis for Design and Development: Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
* Cost and Time Estimation: Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.
* Quality Assurance: Ensures that the final product meets the specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

1. Requirement Gathering 🗂️
* Interviews: Conducting interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed information about their needs and expectations.
* Surveys/Questionnaires: Distributing surveys to collect requirements from a larger audience.
* Workshops: Organizing workshops with stakeholders to discuss and gather requirements.
* Observation: Observing end-users in their working environment to understand their needs.
* Document Analysis: Reviewing existing documentation and systems to understand current functionalities and requirements.

2. Requirement Elicitation ✍️
* Brainstorming: Conducting brainstorming sessions to generate ideas and gather requirements.
* Focus Groups: Holding focus group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
* Prototyping: Creating prototypes to help stakeholders visualize the system and refine their requirements.

3. Requirement Documentation 📚
* Requirement Specification Document: Creating a detailed document that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.
* User Stories: Writing user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective.
* Use Cases: Creating use case diagrams to show interactions between users and the system.

4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling 📊
* Requirement Prioritization: Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project.
* Feasibility Analysis: Assessing the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical, financial, and time constraints.
* Modeling: Creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.

5. Requirement Validation ✅
* Review and Approval: Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Acceptance Criteria: Defining clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards.
* Traceability: Establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements

Functional Requirements ⚙️
* Definition: Describe what the system should do.
* Examples: User authentication, property search, booking system, user registration.
* Key Functional Requirements:
    * Search Properties: Users should be able to search for properties based on various criteria such as location, price, and availability.
    * User Registration: New users should be able to create an account with personal details and login credentials.
    * Property Listings: Display properties with essential details and images.
    * Booking System: Users should be able to book properties, view booking details, and manage their bookings.
    * User Authentication: Secure login and registration process for users. 
Non-functional Requirements 🛡️
* Definition: Describe how the system should perform.
* Examples: Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.
* Key Non-functional Requirements:
    * Performance: The system should load pages within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users.
    * Security: Ensure data encryption, secure login, and protect against common vulnerabilities.
    * Scalability: The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle increased traffic.
    * Usability: The application should have an intuitive UI/UX, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks.
    * Reliability: The system should have an uptime of 99.9% and recover quickly from any failures.

## Use Case Diagrams.
Use case diagrams show how different users (actors) interact with the system to achieve specific goals (use cases).

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
   * Provide a clear visual representation of system functionalities.
   * Help in identifying and organizing system requirements.
   * Facilitate communication among stakeholders and the development team.

### Use cases
👥 Actors
   * Customer – Books services and manages bookings.
   * Admin – Manages users, services, and bookings.
🎯 Use Cases
   * Register / Log in (Customer, Admin)
   * Search Property (Customer)
   * View Property Details (Customer)
   * Book Property (Customer)
   * Cancel Booking (Customer)
   * Manage Property (Admin)
   * View All Bookings (Admin)
   * Update Booking Status (Admin)
   * Generate Reports (Admin)
